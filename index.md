## Research Interests

- Embedded System
- Unicycle Robot
- IoT-enabled home

My current learning focuses on **embedded linux systems** and the **Smart Internet of Things**. My interest is embedded systems. I will design some interesting iot devices like **Smart_Click** or **WiFi-servo-controller**. The most interesting thing I ever made was a **unicycle robot**. I believe that the Internet of Things is going to shape the future of our society. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
