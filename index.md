    Welcome to my academic homepage! I received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from Fuzhou University’s Maynooth International Engineering College, Fuzhou, China, in 2025. In the latter half of 2025, I commenced pursuing the M.Sc. degree in electronics with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
    <br><br>
    My research interests encompass industrial Internet of Things, wireless sensing, applied machine learning, and related domains. I am currently with the Delta-NTU Corporate Lab for Cyber-Physical Systems, Nanyang Technological University, and my present research focuses on millimeter-wave radar and human activity recognition (HAR). If you are interested in any aspect of my work or potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out via email at jiacheng008@e.ntu.edu.sg.
